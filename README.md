# neural-network-challenge-1
You work at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. Your team has asked you to create a model to predict student loan repayment.

The business team has given you a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.
## Code Considerations
* Throughout this assignment I referenced the files we went over in class as well as the recommendations provided in Google Colab to determine the best way to structure and write my own code.
* I did not use tutoring services or the Xpert Learning Assistant for this assignment.
